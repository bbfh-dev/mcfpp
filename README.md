# MCFunction++

A [beet](https://github.com/mcbeet/beet) plugin designed to ease the development of [Minecraft data-packs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack).
It gives a pythonic way of writing code, which is different from how [bolt](https://github.com/mcbeet/bolt) does it.

**Features**:

- Removes mcfunction boilerplate code (events, variables, etc.).
- Allows for python â†’ mcfunction code generation (`for`, `while`, etc.).
- Built-in scoreboard math support (e.g. `sin(a) * b`).
- Support for custom entities, items, & more.
- Highly flexable, allowing for creating solutions to specific problems.

**Standard library**:

MCFunction++ has a standard library containing helpful mcfpp projects to be included in the pipeline.
